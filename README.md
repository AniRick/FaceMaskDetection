# FaceMaskDetection
use a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a popular deep learning technique for image classification tasks. I implemented the model using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras. The CNN model helped extract important features from the images. I also included  regularization. The model was trained on the training dataset for 50 epochs.
